# Performance-learning analytics

Newcastle university has gathered information about the users that have attended this course and are wanting to perform learning Analytics on this data to get insight into student engagement.

Learning Analytics is a rapidly-growing application area for Data Science, defined as “the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environment in which it occurs”

As there is no formal requirement on the question that the university wants to be investigated I decided that I wanted to get a better understanding of why a user leaves the course. I feel like this would be a good measure of engagement as If could the common reasons and trends that are causing people to want to leave the course, then with these findings future courses improve in ways that would stop people leaving the, keeping users engaged and lower the amount of people that leave the course. 

Because of this my business object will be "give useful insights into why people decide to leave the course"
