# Performance-learning analytics


In this I performed an EDA while using the CRISP-dm model to find ways that Newcastle University could increase people completeing their online summer classes. My business object was "give useful insights into why people decide to leave the course".

- Background

Newcastle University has gathered information about the users that have attended an online course and are wanting to perform learning Analytics on this data to get insight into student engagement.

Learning Analytics is a rapidly-growing application area for Data Science, defined as “the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environment in which it occurs”

I wanted to get a better understanding of why a user leaves the course. I feel like this would be a good measure of engagement as If could get the common reasons and trends that are causing people to want to leave the course, then with these findings could be improved in future courses improve to hopful reduce people leaving and keep more people engaged.
